The game is played on a board with specific rules, and you will need to implement the core game logic by completing the `play`, `valid_move`, and `winning_eval` functions. You are provided with the `init` and `display_board` functions. The assignment is divided into two parts:"

    "\n",
    "For the first part of the assignment, students will work on a small Mancala board. The board consists of 3 pits, each initially containing 2 stones. The students need to implement the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **play**: Implement the `play` function to allow players to take turns and make moves. The function should correctly distribute stones according to the specified game rules. The game should also switch between players after each play. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **valid_move**: Implement the `valid_move` function to ensure that a player's chosen move is valid. It should check if the selected pit is not empty and falls within the allowed pit range. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **winning_eval**: Implement the `winning_eval` function to determine when the game is over and which player wins. The game ends when any player's pits are all empty. The winner is the player with the most stones in their mancala. If both mancalas have the same number of stones, it's a tie. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should test their code by playing a sequence of moves starting with Player 1: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. \\\n",
    "So, it would be P1 picks pit 1, P2 picks pit 2, P1 picks pit 3...and so on.\n",

    "In the second part of the assignment, students will extend their implementation to a larger board. The board consists of 6 pits with 4 stones in each pit. In addition to the `play`, `valid_move`, and `winning_eval` functions, students need to create a random move generator for a random player. This random player selects a random valid pit with stones to make a move. The following steps are involved in creating the random move generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Move Generator**: Define the `random_move_generator` that selects a random pit from the available non-empty pits for the random player. The random player should choose a move based on these criteria. \\\n",
