    "$\\textbf{Summary:}$ Up until now, we have implemented the random versus random player as well as the AI player using the minmax_decision() algorithm provided by the Aima python library in the games.py file. Since we have not incorporated Alpha Beta pruning yet we added a depth limit to this function to limit the search depth to that we are able to test it at a faster rate. This is where a trade-off between accuracy and performance is made. Currently below the depth limit is set to 5 as per recommended in the .pdf.   \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{AI Player Summary:}$ While approaching this problem I was going back and forth on how to implement the AI player. In the end, I decided it made the most sense to make the player its own class that takes in the Mancala game as a parameter. This approach gave the AI player the ability to query the state of the game and make informed decisions based on both the utility function further down the tree. How it works is the player takes in the current state of the game then the getState() function is called that just grabs the current player and the board. This is then put into a dictionary for clarity. After that miniMax takes in the state, game, and depth of the state it will be evaluating. Minimax runs its algorithm checking the possible actions each time assessing the utility and eventually returning the max of all these results providing it does not go over its depth limit that is set at 5 right now. Based on this the decision is made to whatever one maximizes the utility for the current player. Observing this when the AI plays as player one it wins about 99% of the time with depth 5 but when the AI is player two it wins about 98%-99% of the time due to the first player's advantage. When we tested a depth of 10 we got the AI player winning 100% of the time against the random player.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Random Player Summary:}$ When working on the game we realized there was an issue with the AI player having unexpected results as a result of an indexing issue. After solving this and playing the random vs random we get that there is almost a 50-48-2 split as a result. So we are fairly confident that the random player is truly random. Below you can uncomment the line in main to test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Future Implementation:}$ Before the final draft of the project is due we plan to implement Alpha Beta pruning as well as an interactive GUI that will allow the user to play against a random player, against the AI with different difficulty ratings, and watch the AI play against a random player.
